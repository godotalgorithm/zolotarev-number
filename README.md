# Zolotarev numbers

This is an ANSI C program to accompany the upcoming revised version of my paper on low-rank approximations of Cauchy kernels [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06911]. While the paper revisions themselves are not finished, I decided to release the accompanying software as soon as it was functional. This repository will be updated with an application to hierarchical compression of real Cauchy matrices when the paper revisions are completed.

The program offers a command-line interface and function interface as discussed in the header of the source code. They are relatively self-explanatory.
