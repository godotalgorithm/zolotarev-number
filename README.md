# Zolotarev numbers

This is an ANSI C program to accompany the revised version of my paper on low-rank approximations of Cauchy kernels [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06911].

The program offers a command-line interface and function interface as discussed in the header of the source code.

They are relatively self-explanatory, but not particularly user friendly.

If anyone does have a serious application for this software, then I will consider making improvements to it in the future.
Besides not being user friendly,
there are known numerical problems (monitored and reported by the solver) that prevent the generation of solutions in a very small fraction of cases.
